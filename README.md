FirefoxOS-Flatfish-kernel
=========================

This repository contains the source code for the Linux kernel of
Firefox OS for the InFocus New Tab F1 device, a tablet sent out to
Mozilla contributors as part of the "Tablet Contribution Program."


The source code combines the Git tree at:
    http://git.hands.com/linux.git
plus the patch on GitHub:
    https://github.com/flatfish-fox/flatfish-kernel
plus this README.md file.

The Git tree appears to be:
  Linux 3.3 + Android 4.2 + AllWinner Tech commits
while the source of the patch is unknown though apparently GPLv2
as well.
